Fixes:

- Fix headphone unplug pausing rewarded video & video interstitial campaigns. This would lead to a deadlock situation in rewarded video and poor user experience in video interstitial

      override to NO if you don't want interstitials displayed until after the
      2nd startSession (for compliance with Human Interface Guidelines)
